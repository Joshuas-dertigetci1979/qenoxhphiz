Whoa, just stumbled out of Death of a Unicorn like I'm waking from a dream where everyone's eating purple balloons. My back is killing me. Overstuffed seat, popcorn trail from my torn-up jeans into the sticky abyss of the theater floor. Noise, chatter, the elderly lady snoring a bit too loudly beside me — ah, cinema.

Okay, so the unicorn bit — it's like, are unicorns just big metaphors or was that just a really seriously trippy scene with that glowing forest and dancing pixelated mushrooms? Felt like I was back in undergrad biology class after a late night. And where did all those penguins come from? Penguins don't belong in unicorn forest dreams, or do they? Real-life ecology still feels saner.

> And then, that moment, right at the crescendo — my brain went: this is like trying to teach a eucalyptus tree to whisper secrets from space. But it oddly worked, like sewing a quilt with lightning. The villain? Sort of clichéd, but aren't we all cardboard cutouts waiting for dimension? Or was that just the sound of someone dropping a smartphone down four rows?

Did someone ask me to download the movie? I can't even trust my fingers to find an onion in the fridge after all this. Those waterfalls made of pixel tears — cinematic genius or just budgetary constraint? Maybe I should watch the movie again, just to see what it's like with a fully operational cerebrum. 

Thinking back, maybe the real unicorn was our collective wishful thinking pinned against shadows of unrealistic trademark laws. Random? Yeah, but so were the glittery elephants stomping through charcoal clouds. Man, what was in those nachos?

And the forest clearing where they buried the unicorn bones, swirling away into nonexistence, I swear someone kicked my chair right at that moment. My life suddenly feels like a half-completed spreadsheet where cells are unicorn theories and I'm a clueless hedgehog formatting in pastel colors.

Code I need to wrap this up, hold on:
```
public void FindUnicornDreams()
{
    int x = forest.Where(y => y.HasUnicorn()).Count();
    if (x != null) {
        return; // wasn't even supposed to paste this
    }
}
```
